/**
 * Holds the session associated with the current request.
 *
 * This utility class was added to work around an incompatibility problem with some Servlet containers (JBoss Web, Tomcat). In
 * these containers, {@link HttpServletRequest#getSession(boolean)} cannot be used within
 * {@link HttpSessionListener#sessionCreated(HttpSession)} method invocation is the created session is not made available.
 * As a result either null is returned or a new session is created (possibly causing an endless loop).
 *
 * This utility class receives an {@link HttpSession} once it is created and holds it until the request is destroyed / session
 * is invalidated.
