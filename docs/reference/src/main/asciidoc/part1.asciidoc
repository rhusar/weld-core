The https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi[CDI] specification defines a set
of complementary services that help improve the structure of application
code. CDI layers an enhanced lifecycle and interaction model over
existing Java component types, including managed beans and Enterprise
Java Beans. The CDI services provide:

* an improved lifecycle for stateful objects, bound to well-defined
_contexts_,
* a typesafe approach to _dependency injection_,
* object interaction via an _event notification facility_,
* a better approach to binding _interceptors_ to objects, along with a
new kind of interceptor, called a _decorator_, that is more appropriate
for use in solving business problems, and
* an _SPI_ for developing portable extensions to the container.

The CDI services are a core aspect of the Jakarta EE platform and include
full support for Jakarta EE modularity and the Jakarta EE component
architecture. But the specification does not limit the use of CDI to the
Jakarta EE environment. Starting with CDI 2.0, the specification covers the use of CDI
in the Java SE environment as well. In Java SE, the services might be
provided by a standalone CDI implementation like Weld (see
ifndef::generate-index-link[<<_cdi_se_module>>]
ifdef::generate-index-link[link:environments.html#_cdi_se_module[CDI SE Module]]
), or even
by a container that also implements the subset of EJB defined for
embedded usage by the EJB 3.2 specification. CDI is especially useful in
the context of web application development, but the problems it solves
are general development concerns and it is therefore applicable to a
wide variety of application.

An object bound to a lifecycle context is called a bean. CDI includes
built-in support for several different kinds of bean, including the
following Java EE component types:

* managed beans, and
* EJB session beans.

Both managed beans and EJB session beans may inject other beans. But
some other objects, which are not themselves beans in the sense used
here, may also have beans injected via CDI. In the Java EE platform, the
following kinds of component may have beans injected:

* message-driven beans,
* interceptors,
* servlets, servlet filters and servlet event listeners,
* JAX-WS service endpoints and handlers,
* JAX-RS resources, providers and `jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application`
subclasses, and
* JSP tag handlers and tag library event listeners.

CDI relieves the user of an unfamiliar API of the need to answer the
following questions:

* What is the lifecycle of this object?
* How many simultaneous clients can it have?
* Is it multithreaded?
* How do I get access to it from a client?
* Do I need to explicitly destroy it?
* Where should I keep the reference to it when I'm not currently using
it?
* How can I define an alternative implementation, so that the
implementation can vary at deployment time?
* How should I go about sharing this object between other objects?

CDI is more than a framework. It's a whole, rich programming model. The
_theme_ of CDI is _loose-coupling with strong typing_. Let's study what
that phrase means.

A bean specifies only the type and semantics of other beans it depends
upon. It need not be aware of the actual lifecycle, concrete
implementation, threading model or other clients of any bean it
interacts with. Even better, the concrete implementation, lifecycle and
threading model of a bean may vary according to the deployment scenario,
without affecting any client. This loose-coupling makes your code easier
to maintain.

Events, interceptors and decorators enhance the loose-coupling inherent
in this model:

* _event notifications_ decouple event producers from event consumers,
* _interceptors_ decouple technical concerns from business logic, and
* _decorators_ allow business concerns to be compartmentalized.

What's even more powerful (and comforting) is that CDI provides all
these facilities in a _typesafe_ way. CDI never relies on string-based
identifiers to determine how collaborating objects fit together.
Instead, CDI uses the typing information that is already available in
the Java object model, augmented using a new programming pattern, called
_qualifier annotations_, to wire together beans, their dependencies,
their interceptors and decorators, and their event consumers. Usage of
XML descriptors is minimized to truly deployment-specific information.

But CDI isn't a restrictive programming model. It doesn't tell you how
you should to structure your application into layers, how you should
handle persistence, or what web framework you have to use. You'll have
to decide those kinds of things for yourself.

CDI even provides a comprehensive SPI, allowing other kinds of object
defined by future Jakarta EE specifications or by third-party frameworks to
be cleanly integrated with CDI, take advantage of the CDI services, and
interact with any other kind of bean.
