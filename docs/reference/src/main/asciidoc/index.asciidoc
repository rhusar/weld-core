= Weld {weldVersion} - CDI Reference Implementation

[preface]
= A note about naming and nomenclature

Throughout this document, mentions of JSR-299, JSR-346 and JSR-365 appear. JSR is
a document of a proposed specification used in the Java Community
Process (JCP). JSRs are somewhat analogous to RFCs used by IETF. JSR-299
and JSR-346 are the JCP specification names for the 1.0 and 1.1 versions
of CDI, respectively. JSR-365 is the JCP specification name for the CDI 2.0 version.

Shortly before the final draft of JSR-299 was submitted, the
specification changed its name from "Web Beans" to "Java Contexts and
Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform", abbreviated CDI. For a
brief period after the renaming, the reference implementation adopted
the name "Web Beans". However, this ended up causing more confusion than
it solved and Red Hat decided to change the name of the reference
implementation to "Weld". You may still find other documentation, blogs,
forum posts, etc. that use the old nomenclature. Please update any
references you can. The naming game is over.

You'll also find that some of the functionality that once existed in the
specification is now missing, such as defining beans in XML. These
features will be available as portable extensions.

Note that this reference guide was started while changes were still
being made to the specification. We've done our best to update it for
accuracy. If you discover a conflict between what is written in this
guide and the specification, the specification is the authorityâ€”assume
it is correct. If you believe you have found an error in the
specification, please report it to the CDI EG.
