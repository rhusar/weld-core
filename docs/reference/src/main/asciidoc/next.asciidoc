A lot of additional information on CDI can be found online. Regardless,
the CDI specification remains the authority for information on CDI. The
spec is fairly readable and it covers many details
we've skipped over here.It is available on the at the Jakarta website
(https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/4.0/jakarta-cdi-spec-4.0.html[CDI 4.0]).

The CDI compatible implementation, Weld, is being developed by the
https://github.com/weld/core/graphs/contributors[Weld team].

We encourage you to follow the
https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/weld-dev[weld-dev] mailing list
and to get involved in http://weld.cdi-spec.org/community/[development].
If you are reading this guide, you likely have something to offer.
